    artist: "Jeff Murell",
    songwriters: ["Jeff Murrell", "Vidal Davis", "Leah Elizabeth Smith"],
    lyrics: `Tell me What's going on. 
Verses 1 
Looked in my rearview 
lights, flashing, red and blue
Man, here we go again 
what do I say What do I do
One false move and this could really be the end. 
I keep my hands on the wheel man here we go again. 
Don't move too fast. 
Don't reach too soon 
cause you're a threat. 
It's already been assumed. 
Just wanna make it home to see my family tonight. 
Can you tell me 
tell me what's going on? 
  
Hook.
Same rules apply 
for you and I but I must die. 
Can you tell me 
tell me what's going on 
Even with Video You say 
we're not seeing what we see 
can you tell me
tell me what's going on

Verse 2
Hundreds of years of free labor, 
and somehow they can make the statement 
that somehow we are lazy 
and all we do is make babies, 
but if we had an upper hand like they did 
then generational wealth would be flowing through our veins 
This land that I love (they say)
Is supposed to be free, (they say)
as long as I've been alive, 
it's never been free for me 
I just wanna be treated equally. 
Can you tell me 
tell me what's going on

Hook.
Same rules apply 
for you and I but I must die. 
Can you tell me 
tell me what's going on 
Even with video you say 
we're not seeing what we see 
can you tell me
tell me what's going on
Tell Me 
Tell Me
Tell Me
Tell Me what's going on
Tell Me
Tell Me
Tell Me
Tell Me what's going on`

    songwriters: ["Fatin Dantzler", "Vidal Davis"],
    lyrics: `Let me tell you some Grown up stuff
I'm here on mamas prayers didn't pray hard enough
It's gratitude not attitude
Dude stepped on my sneakers and I ain't even mad at dude
Pooling resources using skills paying down all my delinquent bills
I'm educated and I'm also black
And I even got my credit in tact

Hook:
Manhood is making sure the fam good
Taking time for self care like one should
Them lessons daddy taught
they were damn good
The world is stressful but they can't take my manhood

Verse 2
It's being responsible and accountable
When the trouble seems insurmountable
In the mist of fear the confidence
It's always using your common sense
It's mind over matter
Calm over tense
It's a marathon this is not a sprint
Life is full of surprises
Take the hint
And you gotta listen to it

Hook repeat

Bridge:
Sure the world gets crazy
And we're all misunderstood
One thing we can't do
We can't let them take our manhood
What's good for the brotherhood
What's good with the fatherhood
Don't let them take your manhood
Don't let them take it don't let them take your manhood …
Ad lib and Hook out`

I've been by your side more than you know
I won't say it's gonna be easy
I'll say that it's worth it all
Now you might not always see
I'm there whenever you call

Just know sometimes I gotta let you fall, dear son
(Had to let you fall dear son)
Cause ups and downs
I've learned that you need them all to grow
(Need them ups and downs to grow dear son)

Your grandpa was the kind to make you find it on your own
But never, oh never did I feel alone
See tough times gonna happen
But you are strong enough to see
Your way through the darkest clouds
Just know, ill be where you need me to be

Just know I sometimes will let you fall dear
(Had to let you fall dear son)
Cause ups and downs, I learned that you need them all to grow
(Need them ups and downs to grow)

I love you 
And it hurt me more when you scraped your knee
I learned that you were tougher than me
And that you would get up and you would be fine
And you learned that your scars would heal up in time
(Dear son)
Sometimes I let you fall dear son
(Had to let you fall dear son)
Cause ups and downs
(Dear son)
I learned that you need them all to grow
(Need them ups and downs to grow)
Sometimes
(Dear son)
Sometimes I had to let you fall dear son 
(Had to let you fall dear son)
Cause ups and downs, I learned that you need them all to grow
(Need them ups and down to grow)
To grow to grow to grow

    lyrics: `My life was spinning out of control
I was lost with nowhere to go
Feeling down and feeling low
Seem like all I got was a no after no
But I refused to settle
keep reaching and believing for better
better situations
This is my determination
This is my motivation

I am not alone
I believe in me
I am not alone
I can conquer anything
I am not alone
I will not fear
When I'm in trouble
I know help is near

I am not, I am not alone
I am not, I am not alone
I am not, I am not alone
I am not, I am not alone

Does anyone see me, I feel forsaken
Does anyone care that my heart is breaking
But I won't lose sight
Because I know my future is bright
I got family and friends
To encourage me along the way
And If I should stray
God is only one prayer away
So I lift my head and say

I am not alone
I believe in me
I am not alone
I can conquer anything
I am not alone
I will not fear
When I'm in trouble
I know help is near
I am not, I am not alone
I am not, I am not alone
I am not, I am not alone
I am not, I am not alone

I'm enjoying
my own company
I'm learning
to love me for me
Alone
doesn't always mean lonely
I choose to use
this space for self-discovery

I'm enjoying

Shot without warning, left to a family mourning.
So don't shoot me down.
So don't gun me down. (Don't gun me down.)
I wonder is this the prayer of a Black men for tomorrow?
Oh, Lord, don't you gun me down. (Don't gun me down.)
Oh, but this can't be the plea for a Black man like me
Sing it, don't blunt [?] me down (Don't blunt me down.)
Say, don't blunt me down. (Don't blunt me down.) Down…
 
Forgive them, Father, for they eat from fetid fruit,
For their judgment from my skin, falsely accused and the innocent.

Brutality. (Brutality.)

All of the ups 
And downs 
But who all
Ways around 
U
Thru & thru
I know 
Fasho that
We got each other
I got u 
U got me 

Let it be known 
So there aint no question 
I gotta favor 

Brotherly 3x
Love

I'll give the same up 
Later is never for lots 
I'm grateful for all that we 
Came from 
Know that we different 
But dealing with feelings 
Is better to do 
When I see someone 
Who's under the same ceiling 
That I'm under 
But trynna remove 
I couldn't do this without u 
U kept my secrets
I wore ur sneakers 
Day in ur shoes 
And I'm proud to 
Holding me
down 4x
Keeping me grounded
The bluntest 
But also the funnest alive 
Running from nothing 
Together we slide
Summers of trouble 
And winters of cries 
Can't cut the ties 
I know that we 

Down for each other 
Know that down for other 
When it's all we know
We know 
never let go  
We got each other
I got u 
U got me

Tell u truth 
We had our moments 
Of throwin the two 
Ducking and dodging the pettiness 
Readiness 
Always ahead of us
Checking the flu 
Temperature 
When we knew exactly what it 
Was gone become
If we hit a button 
But after the rage 
And after the stage 
We often engaged in something 
Brodie 
U got me inspired to write 
Thru struggle and plight 
Pardon the shine 
Often we grew into separate at night 
But Woke up alike 
Splitting the time 
Momma new something 
By letting us fight 
Cause it was a knife 
That sharpened the iron
A world where there wasn't 
a me and u in It 
I couldn't imagine 
And wouldn't've tried`
